# teleBot
Just playing around with Telegram's Bot APi

Need to install this python module first

```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
```

- Get new 'Anteprima' from Panini.it based on the issue requested
- Filtering msg from a specific Telegram Channel
- Inline query towards Comicsbox.it 


TO-do:
- Implement older feature with new library version
- Double-check presence of 'jq' utility on the system
- Fix service configuration file
- Implement logging feature
